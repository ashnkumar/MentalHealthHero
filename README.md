# Mental Health Hero - Tigergraph Hackathon (Graph for All)
Repository with the source code and data to replicate and run our Mental Health Challenge demo for the Tigergraph Graph for All Hackathon.



###ðŸ‘‰ Step 1: Download our solution from this repository
Download the file **mentalhealthhero.tar.gz** from this repository.


###ðŸ‘‰ Step 2: Import the solution into your instance.
On the Tigergraph console, import the **mentalhealthhero.tar.gz** file into your Tigergraph instance by clicking "Import an Existing Solution".


###ðŸ‘‰ Step 3: Add the data files to your Tigergraph instance
Please download all the CSV files in the **data/** folder in this repository, then on the "Map Data" section in Tigergraph, add all those files (with those exact filenames!).

You _may_ need to publish the Design Schema and "Map Data to Graph" areas too.


###ðŸ‘‰ Step 4: Explore the graph
In the Explore Graph section, you can try selecting a few vertices to explore the graph.

Try using the vertex type Person, with Vertex id of "patient17" to see an example!


###ðŸ‘‰ Step 5: Run the mental health treatment plan recommendation query
In the "Write queries" section, you'll find the query titles **find_mental_health_recommendations" as a GSQL query.

Try putting in an example like **patient17** and run the query to find similar patients, who can point to potential recommended treatment plans.
