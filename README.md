### ðŸ‘‰ Step 1: Download our solution from this repository
Download the file **mentalhealthhero.tar.gz** from this repository.


### ðŸ‘‰ Step 2: Import the solution into your instance.
On the Tigergraph console, import the **mentalhealthhero.tar.gz** file into your Tigergraph instance by clicking "Import an Existing Solution".


### ðŸ‘‰ Step 3: Add the data files to your Tigergraph instance
Please unzip the **data.zip** file to download all the CSVs to your comptuer, and then in Tigergraph on the "Map Data" section in Tigergraph, add all those files (with those exact filenames!).

You _may_ need to publish the Design Schema and "Map Data to Graph" areas too.


### ðŸ‘‰ Step 4: Load data into graph
In the "Load Data" section of Graphstudio, press the play icon to load the data.


### ðŸ‘‰ Step 5: Explore the graph
Once the data is loaded, in the Explore Graph section, you can try selecting a few vertices to explore the graph.

Try using the vertex type Person, with Vertex id of "patient17" to see an example!


### ðŸ‘‰ Step 6: Run the mental health treatment plan recommendation query
In the "Write queries" section, install the following queries:
* **find_mental_health_recommendations**
* **find_similar_ad_hoc**
* **patient_journey_subgraph**

Try putting in an example like **patient17** for the "find_mental_health_recommendations" query to find similar patients, who can point to potential recommended treatment plans.


### ðŸ‘‰ Step 7 (optional): Connect our front-end to your instance! ([cached demo site here](https://mental-health-hero.herokuapp.com/))
You'll need to clone this repository down and do some configuration to get the frontend working live on localhost:
1. Clone this repository and go into the `frontenddemo` folder
2. Copy the `configtemplate.json` into a new file called `config.json` in the same root level directory
3. In this `config.json file` change the following:
  a) replace `tg_token` with your Tigergraph API token which you can get by following [these instructions](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/current/api/built-in-endpoints#_request_a_token)
  b) In Tigergraph Graphstudio, find your URL for the following queries and modify those in the `config.json` file (do NOT include the params - see `configtemplate.json` for examples):
    1. patient_journey_subgraph
    2. find_mental_health_recommendations
    3. find_similar_ad_hoc
  c) Delete the comments in the `config.json` file!
2. Run the following commands to install requirements and launch demo
```
cd MentalHealthHeros
cd frontenddemo
npm install && cd client && npm install
cd ..
npm start

// In new terminal window:
cd client
npm start
```
3. The demo should be running at http://localhost:3000/
